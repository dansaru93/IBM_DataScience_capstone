# IBM Data Science capstone course


In this project, I apply data science skills for a private space launch company.

As a starting point of almost all data science projects, I collect data, as much and relevant as possible.
After collect the raw data, I will improve the data quality by performing data wrangling. 
Then I explore the processed data. Here I will get to practice SQL skills as we query the data and gather insights.  
Some basic statistical analysis and data visualization will be applied to gain further insights into the data. 
Thus, it can be directly seen how variables might be related to each other.   

I'll drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data.  
More exciting insights will be discoverd by building, evaluating, and refining predictive models.

Finally, I create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all previous analysis.
